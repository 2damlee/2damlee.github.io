## Correlation and Regression
<br>

### Correlation(상관분석)
> display relationships between two variables by means of tables and by means of graphs. 
- When the variables in the study are measured on the nominal -> `contingency table`
- When they are measured on a quantitative level -> `scatterplot`
<br>
#### Pearson's r
> shows us the direction and exact strength of the linear relationship between two qualititative variables.
- Pearson's r is always a number between -1 and 1. 
  - -1 refers to a perfect negative correlation
  - +1 to a perfect positive correlation 
  - 0 means that there is no correlation at all

### Regression(회귀 분석)
<br>
Describing the line<br>

`y^ = a + bx`<br>
- y^ = predicted value of y
- a = intercept(절편)
- b = regression coefficient(회귀계수, 종속변수에 미치는 영향력)
<br><br>
How good is the line? <br>
  Squared Residual(RSS, 잔차 제곱합)<br>
: a measure of the discrepancy between the data and an estimation model(ex. linear regression)
 - For example, r-squared is 0.69. This means that the prediction error is 69% smaller when we use the regression line than when we employ the mean.
